Simple Weather App

This is a small Node.js project that shows the current weather of any city. It uses the Open-Meteo API to get live temperature, windspeed, and time, and displays it on a basic webpage. The backend is built with Express, and the frontend uses plain HTML and CSS.

What this project does

When you type a city name on the webpage, the app calls the backend route /weather?city=CityName.
The backend connects to the Open-Meteo API, fetches the city’s current weather, and sends that data back to the frontend, which then displays it neatly on the screen.

**To Do (Homework)**

Update the app so that it also shows a 10-day temperature forecast instead of just the current weather.

Go to the Open-Meteo website, read the API documentation, and figure out which endpoint or parameters to use to get daily temperature forecasts.
Change your code so it displays something like this on the page:

        Day 1: High 75°F / Low 59°F
        Day 2: High 77°F / Low 60°F
…

You can design how it looks however you want just make sure the website shows 10 day's temp data on it.
